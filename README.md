## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains well-structured, production-ready implementations of all 23 classic design patterns from the Gang of Four (GoF) book. Each pattern includes:

- ✅ **Clean, refactored code** following Java best practices
- ✅ **Comprehensive unit tests** with JUnit 5
- ✅ **JavaDoc documentation** for all classes and methods
- ✅ **Real-world examples** demonstrating practical usage
- ✅ **Maven project structure** for easy building and dependency management

## 🏗️ Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

| [Factory Method](design-patterns/factoryMethod) | Creates objects without specifying the exact class | ✅ |
| [Prototype](design-patterns/prototype) | Creates objects by cloning existing instances | ✅ |
| [Singleton](design-patterns/singleton) | Ensures a class has only one instance | ✅ |

### Structural Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|

| [Mediator](design-patterns/mediator) | Defines how objects interact with each other | ✅ |
| [Memento](design-patterns/memento) | Captures and restores an object's internal state | ✅ |
| [Observer](design-patterns/observer) | Notifies multiple objects about state changes | ✅ |
| [State](design-patterns/state) | Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes | ✅ |
| [Strategy](design-patterns/strategy) | Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable | ✅ |
| [Template Method](design-patterns/templateMethod) | Defines the skeleton of an algorithm | ✅ |
| [Visitor](design-patterns/visitor) | Separates algorithms from the objects they operate on | ✅ |

## 📚 Pattern Categories

### Creational Patterns
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

**Key Patterns:**
- **Abstract Factory**: Create families of related objects
- **Builder**: Construct complex objects step by step
- **Factory Method**: Delegate object creation to subclasses
- **Prototype**: Clone objects for creation
- **Singleton**: Ensure single instance existence

### Structural Patterns
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

**Key Patterns:**
- **Adapter**: Make incompatible interfaces compatible
- **Bridge**: Separate abstraction from implementation
- **Composite**: Compose objects into tree structures
- **Decorator**: Add responsibilities dynamically
- **Facade**: Provide unified interface to subsystem
- **Flyweight**: Share state to reduce memory usage
- **Proxy**: Control access to objects

### Behavioral Patterns
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

**Key Patterns:**
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Pass requests along a chain
- **Command**: Encapsulate requests as objects
- **Interpreter**: Define grammar representation
- **Iterator**: Access elements sequentially
- **Mediator**: Define object interaction
- **Memento**: Capture and restore state
- **Observer**: Notify dependents of changes
- **State**: Alter behavior with state changes
- **Strategy**: Define interchangeable algorithms
- **Template Method**: Define algorithm skeleton
- **Visitor**: Separate algorithms from objects

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Abstract Factory Example

```java
AbstractFactory factory = new InternalEmployeeFactory();
Employee employee = new Employee(factory);
String payroll = employee.generatePayroll();
```

### Singleton Example

```java
DatabaseConnection connection = DatabaseConnection.getInstance();
```

### Strategy Example

```java
User user = new User();
String result = user.savePDF("document");
```
